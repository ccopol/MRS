The Stanford CNI MRS Library (SMAL) 
=======================

This library provides algorithms and methods to read and analyze data from
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) experiments. It provides an API for
fitting models of the spectral line-widths of several different molecular
species, and quantify their relative abundance in human brain tissue.
